## Self-Service Resources

### üìñ Documentation

Start with these documents before opening issues:

1. **[ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md)**: 15-minute setup guide
2. **[MASTER_GUIDE.md](MASTER_GUIDE.md)**: System overview and quickstart
3. **[ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)**: System design and data flow
4. **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Development workflow
5. **Service-specific docs**: Each repo has README, API_SPEC, RUNBOOK, TEST_STRATEGY

### üîß Troubleshooting Guides

**Common Issues**:
- **[Gateway RUNBOOK](repos/at-gateway/RUNBOOK.md)**: Operational procedures and troubleshooting
- **[Error Catalog](repos/at-gateway/ERROR_CATALOG.md)**: Error codes and solutions
- **Setup Issues**: See [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) "Common Pitfalls" section

**Quick Checks**:
```bash
# Service health
curl http://localhost:8001/healthz

# Infrastructure status
docker compose ps

# NATS connectivity
nats server ping

# Recent errors
docker compose logs --tail=50 gateway | grep ERROR
```

### üéØ FAQ

**Q: How do I generate a valid webhook signature?**

A: See the authentication example in [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md#test-4-send-test-webhook) or [Gateway API_SPEC](repos/at-gateway/API_SPEC.md#complete-authentication-example).

**Q: Why am I getting 401 authentication errors?**

A: Common causes:
1. Incorrect HMAC secret
2. Clock skew > 30 seconds
3. Reused nonce
4. Malformed signature header

See [Gateway ERROR_CATALOG](repos/at-gateway/ERROR_CATALOG.md#gw-001-invalid-signature) for detailed troubleshooting.

**Q: How do I check if NATS is working?**

A:
```bash
# Test NATS connectivity
nats server ping

# Check streams
nats stream ls

# Monitor events
nats sub "signals.*"
```

**Q: Where can I find error codes and their meanings?**

A: Each service has an ERROR_CATALOG.md file (e.g., [Gateway Error Catalog](repos/at-gateway/ERROR_CATALOG.md)) with complete error code references.

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**

A: Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development workflow, then pick a ticket from `workspace/tickets/`.

### What Makes a Good Issue

‚úÖ **Good Example**:
```
Title: "Gateway returns 401 for valid TradingView webhooks after key rotation"

Environment: at-gateway v1.2.0, Python 3.12, Docker 24.0.0

Steps:
1. Rotated API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET from X to Y
2. Updated TradingView webhook config with new signature
3. Sent test webhook with correct timestamp and nonce

Expected: 202 Accepted
Actual: 401 with error code GW-001

Logs:
{
  "level": "ERROR",
  "corr_id": "req_abc123",
  "error": "invalid_signature",
  "client_ip": "1.2.3.4"
}

Configuration:
API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET=[REDACTED]
REPLAY_WINDOW_SEC=300
```

‚ùå **Poor Example**:
```
Title: "Webhooks not working"

it doesn't work, help???
```

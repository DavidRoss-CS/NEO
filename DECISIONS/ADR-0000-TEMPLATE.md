# ADR-0000: [Short Title of Decision]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Context
[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.]

**Problem Statement**: What specific problem are we solving?

**Key Requirements**:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

**Constraints**:
- Technical constraints (existing systems, performance requirements)
- Business constraints (timeline, budget, resources)
- Regulatory constraints (compliance, security requirements)

## Decision
[This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."]

**Chosen Solution**: Brief summary of what we decided to do.

**Key Design Points**:
- Design decision 1 and rationale
- Design decision 2 and rationale
- Design decision 3 and rationale

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Consequences
[This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.]

### Positive
- Benefit 1: Explanation
- Benefit 2: Explanation
- Benefit 3: Explanation

### Negative
- Trade-off 1: Explanation and mitigation strategy
- Trade-off 2: Explanation and mitigation strategy
- Risk 1: Probability and impact assessment

### Neutral
- Impact 1: Neither clearly positive nor negative
- Impact 2: Dependency or coupling introduced

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternative solutions that were evaluated and explain why they were not chosen.]

### Alternative 1: [Name]
**Description**: Brief description of the alternative
**Pros**: Why this could work
**Cons**: Why this was rejected

### Alternative 2: [Name]
**Description**: Brief description of the alternative
**Pros**: Why this could work
**Cons**: Why this was rejected

## ADR Writing Guidelines

### When to Write an ADR
- Architecture-significant decisions
- Technology choices that affect multiple teams
- Decisions with long-term consequences
- Trade-offs between competing approaches
- Security or compliance decisions

### ADR Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language; provide concrete details
2. **Show Your Work**: Explain the reasoning behind the decision
3. **Consider All Stakeholders**: Think about impacts on different teams
4. **Update Status**: Keep the status current as decisions evolve
5. **Link Generously**: Reference related ADRs and documentation
6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit ADRs during architecture reviews

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Draft**: Initial version for review and feedback
2. **Review**: Team review and stakeholder input
3. **Decision**: Final decision made and ADR accepted
4. **Implementation**: Decision is being implemented
5. **Evaluation**: Monitor outcomes and measure success
6. **Maintenance**: Update as needed, deprecate if superseded

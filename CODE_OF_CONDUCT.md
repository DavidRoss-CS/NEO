# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
* **Being collaborative** and helping others learn and grow
* **Respecting time zones and availability** of global team members
* **Providing constructive code reviews** focused on improvement, not criticism

* **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
* **Public or private harassment**
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

* **Discrimination** based on any protected characteristics
* **Persistent disruption** of discussions or meetings
* **Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual imagery** in community spaces

## Community Guidelines

### Technical Collaboration

* **Code reviews should be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person. Provide specific, actionable feedback.
* **Assume positive intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt and ask for clarification when unsure.
* **Share knowledge freely**: Help others learn and grow through mentoring and documentation.
* **Respect different skill levels**: We all started somewhere. Be patient with those learning.
* **Follow established processes**: Use our PR templates, ADR process, and testing standards.

### Communication Standards

* **Use inclusive language**: Avoid terms that may exclude or alienate community members.
* **Be concise and clear**: Respect others' time by being direct and specific in communication.
* **Document decisions**: Use ADRs for architectural decisions and update relevant documentation.
* **Respond promptly**: Acknowledge messages even if you can't provide a full response immediately.
* **Use appropriate channels**: Keep discussions in relevant forums (security issues via email, etc.).

### Conflict Resolution

* **Address issues directly**: Speak with individuals privately before escalating concerns.
* **Seek to understand**: Listen actively and try to understand different perspectives.
* **Focus on solutions**: Work together to find constructive resolutions.
* **Escalate when needed**: Don't hesitate to involve maintainers when direct resolution isn't possible.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
* GitHub repositories and associated tools (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions)
* Communication channels (Slack, Discord, mailing lists)
* Virtual and in-person events and meetings
* Social media interactions when representing the project
* Any other community forums or spaces
